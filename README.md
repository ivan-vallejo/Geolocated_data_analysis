## Ivan Vallejo Vall, September 2017

This repository contains the analysis of a real-world dataset. The dataset aggregates data transmitted from a number of cars while they are driving around the United Kingdom.

The raw data cannot be shared because of privacy issues. Nevertheless, the aggregate results of an analysis of the vehicle flows of these fleet are presented in the PDF file 'geolocation_analysis.pdf'.

The data analysis is implemented using R. The file ’code_vehicles.R’ contains the code used to perform the analysis and generate the charts.
